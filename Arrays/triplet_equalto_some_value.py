"""
Algorithm : 
(1)Sort the given array.
(2)Loop over the array and fix the first element of the possible triplet, arr[i].
(3) Then fix two pointers, one at i + 1 and the other at n â€“ 1. And look at the sum, 
    - If the sum is smaller than the required sum, increment the first pointer.
    - Else, If the sum is bigger, Decrease the end pointer to reduce the sum.
    - Else, if the sum of elements at two-pointer is equal to given sum then print the triplet and break.
    
Time complexity : O(n**2)
Space complexity : O(1)
