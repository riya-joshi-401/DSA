- The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements “bubble” to the top of the list.
- Worst case complexity : O(n**2)
- Best case complexity (Improved version) : O(n)
- Average case complexity (Basic version) : O(n**2)
- Worst case space complexity : O(1) auxiliary
- The only significant advantage that bubble sort has over other implementations is that it can detect whether the input list is already sorted or not.
