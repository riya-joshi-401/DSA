- Worst case complexity: Θ(n**2)
- Best case complexity: Θ(n)
- Average case complexity: Θ(n**2)
- Worst case space complexity: O(n**2) total, O(1) auxiliary

Notes:

• Bubble sort takes (n**2/2) comparisons and (n**2/2) swaps (inversions) in both average case
and in worst case.

• Selection sort (n**2/2) takes comparisons and n swaps.

• Insertion sort takes (n**2/4) comparisons and (n**2/8) swaps in average case and in the worst
case they are double.

• Insertion sort is almost linear for partially sorted input.

• Selection sort is best suits for elements with bigger values and small keys.
