- Selection sort works well for small files.
- It is used for sorting the files with very large values and small keys.
- This is because selection is made based on keys and swaps are made only when required.
- This algorithm is called selection sort since it repeatedly selects the smallest element.
- Worst case complexity : O(n**2)
- Best case complexity : O(n**2)
- Average case complexity : O(n**2)
- Worst case space complexity: O(1) auxiliary
