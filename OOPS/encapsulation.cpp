// Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit

/*

Consider a real life example of encapsulation, in a company there are different sections like the accounts
section, finance section, sales section etc. The finance section handles all the financial transactions and 
keep records of all the data related to finance. Similarly the sales section handles all the sales related 
activities and keep records of all the sales. Now there may arise a situation when for some reason an official 
from finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular month. In this case, he is not allowed to 
directly access the data of sales section. He will first have to contact some other officer in the sales section 
and then request him to give the particular data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of sales section and 
the employees that can manipulate them are wrapped under a single name “sales section”.

*/

// Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides the data.

// exaample: like if someone isdriving a car so he/she might not know the car's actual mechanical part and inner structure he only knows break, 
// accelator, and steering.So, here basically the information about the car is hidden from the driver for simplification of things.

// A class has two things: data memebers and member functions
// Access modifiers: public,private, protected
// 1- Public: objects can access these data members and fucntions outside the class, inside the class and inside the derived/inherited class
// 2- Private: objects cannot access the data members and functions outside the class or from a derived/inherited class. They can be only accessed inside the class.
// 3- Protected: objects cannot access the data members and functions outside the class , They can accessed inside the classs and derived/inherited class.

// Advantages:
// good practice, increases security of our data
